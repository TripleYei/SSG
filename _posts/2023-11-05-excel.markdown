# Excel

We'll start easy. All formulas in Excel start with = . Find the total January revenue by typing =B2+B3 
~~~~
=B2+B3
~~~~

A better way to add numbers is to use the SUM function. Find total January revenue by typing =SUM(B2, B3)
Notice how the function's arguments are separated by commas.

~~~~
=SUM(B2,B3)
~~~~

You can pass a group of cells to a function by using a colon. B2:B6 tells Excel "every cell from B2 to B6". Find January Revenue by typing =SUM(B2:B6)

~~~~
=SUM(B2:B6)
~~~~


Now use the SUM function to find total revenue for February.

~~~~
=SUM(C2:C6)
~~~~

The CFO tells you that February revenue was misreported and the total needs to be increased by $100. Type =SUM(C2:C6, 100)

~~~
=SUM(C2:C6, 100)
~~~~

Use the SUM function with the argument B7:G7 to find the total revenue from January to June

~~~~
=SUM(B7:G7)
~~~~

Use the SUM function to find the total revenue of Product A, Product C, and Consulting, all for JANUARY ONLY. Hint: The arguments look like this (?, ?, ?)

~~~~
=SUM(B2,B4,B6)
~~~~
