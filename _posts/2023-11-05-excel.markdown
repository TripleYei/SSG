# Excel

We'll start easy. All formulas in Excel start with = . Find the total January revenue by typing =B2+B3 
~~~~
=B2+B3
~~~~

A better way to add numbers is to use the SUM function. Find total January revenue by typing =SUM(B2, B3)
Notice how the function's arguments are separated by commas.

~~~~
=SUM(B2,B3)
~~~~

You can pass a group of cells to a function by using a colon. B2:B6 tells Excel "every cell from B2 to B6". Find January Revenue by typing =SUM(B2:B6)

~~~~
=SUM(B2:B6)
~~~~


Now use the SUM function to find total revenue for February.

~~~~
=SUM(C2:C6)
~~~~

The CFO tells you that February revenue was misreported and the total needs to be increased by $100. Type =SUM(C2:C6, 100)

~~~
=SUM(C2:C6, 100)
~~~~

Use the SUM function with the argument B7:G7 to find the total revenue from January to June

~~~~
=SUM(B7:G7)
~~~~

Use the SUM function to find the total revenue of Product A, Product C, and Consulting, all for JANUARY ONLY. Hint: The arguments look like this (?, ?, ?)

~~~~
=SUM(B2,B4,B6)
~~~~


The COUNT function counts all the cells that contain numbers in a specified range. Try typing =COUNT(A2:E2) to get a return value of 4

~~~~
=COUNT(A2:E2)
~~~~

COUNT only counts the cells that contain numbers. What would =COUNT(A1:A5) return?

~~~~
3
~~~~

Write a COUNT function that counts how many students have at least one pet.

~~~~
=COUNT(B2:B8)
~~~~

The following table contains Q1 sales. Write a COUNT function to count how many sales people made at least one sale in January.

~~~~
=COUNT(B2:B5)
~~~~

Write a COUNT function that would count the number of months that Chuck made at least one sale in Q1 (January through March)

~~~~
=COUNT(B4:D4)
~~~~

In Excel, logical functions and decision-making are built with statements that evaluate to true or false. There are 6 logical operators to determine true or false, and they are listed in the table below.
The statement 1=1 is true, because 1 is equal to 1.
Would 1=2 evaluate to True or False?

~~~~
False
~~~~

The statement 1<>1 evaluates to false, because <> means "not equal to," and it would be false to say "1 is not equal to 1."
What would 1<>2 evaluate to?

~~~~
True
~~~~

The statement 4>=1 evaluates to true, because >= means "greater than or equal to," and 4 is greater than or equal to 1.
What would 1<=2 evaluate to?

~~~~
True
~~~~

What would 1<=1 evaluate to?

~~~~
True
~~~~


What would B5=C5 evaluate to?

B5 = 950, C5 = 950

~~~~
True
~~~~

What would B2>B3 evaluate to?

B2 = 1000, B3 = 1200

~~~~
False
~~~~

What would B2>=C6 evaluate to?

B2 = 1000, C6= 1000

~~~~
True
~~~~


VLOOKUP, or Vertical Lookup, finds a value in a vertical list and returns the corresponding value in an adjacent vertical list. Get the year of hurricane Ike by typing this formula into the field below: =VLOOKUP("Ike", A1:B4, 2, 0)

~~~~
=VLOOKUP("Ike", A1:B4, 2, 0)
~~~~

The first argument (values separated by commas) is the match value (what VLOOKUP looks for first). The second argument is the search area. The third argument is how many columns to the right the lookup will search (including the current column). Find the year of hurricane Sandy with: =VLOOKUP("Sandy", A1:D4, 4, 0)

~~~~
=VLOOKUP("Sandy", A1:D4, 4, 0)
~~~~


The final argument, 0, just means that you're looking for an exact match, rather than an approximate match. Don't worry about this for now; it'll be 0 in most cases. Find the MAKE of the Impala using a VLOOKUP formula

~~~~
=VLOOKUP("Impala", A1:B3, 2, 0)
~~~~

Find the YEAR of the RAV4 using vlookup

~~~~
=VLOOKUP("RAV4", A1:C3, 3, 0)
~~~~

Use VLOOKUP to find the name of the tenant in unit number 254. Use A:B as your second argument to include all of columns A and B in your search range.

~~~~
=VLOOKUP(254, A:B, 2, 0)
~~~~

Using the A:B range, use VLOOKUP to find the name of the student who scored 95 on the test

~~~~
=VLOOKUP(95, A:B, 2, 0)
~~~~

Using the B:C range, use VLOOKUP to find Patrick's major

~~~~
=VLOOKUP("Patrick", B:C, 2, 0)
~~~~

Use LEN( ) to get the number of characters in text. Type =LEN(A2) in the field below to get the length of the text in cell A2

~~~~
=LEN(A2)
~~~~

Use LEFT( ) to get the left-most characters of some text. Type =LEFT(A2, 4) to return the 4 left-most characters in the text, which is "Mike"

~~~~
=LEFT(A2, 4)
~~~~

RIGHT( ) returns the right-most characters of some text. Try using =RIGHT( ) to return "Johnson"

~~~~
=RIGHT(A2,7)
~~~~

What would LEN(A2) return? (Don't forget the space!)

~~~~
12
~~~~
