# Excel

We'll start easy. All formulas in Excel start with = . Find the total January revenue by typing =B2+B3 
~~~~
=B2+B3
~~~~

A better way to add numbers is to use the SUM function. Find total January revenue by typing =SUM(B2, B3)
Notice how the function's arguments are separated by commas.

~~~~
=SUM(B2,B3)
~~~~

You can pass a group of cells to a function by using a colon. B2:B6 tells Excel "every cell from B2 to B6". Find January Revenue by typing =SUM(B2:B6)

~~~~
=SUM(B2:B6)
~~~~


Now use the SUM function to find total revenue for February.

~~~~
=SUM(C2:C6)
~~~~

The CFO tells you that February revenue was misreported and the total needs to be increased by $100. Type =SUM(C2:C6, 100)

~~~
=SUM(C2:C6, 100)
~~~~

Use the SUM function with the argument B7:G7 to find the total revenue from January to June

~~~~
=SUM(B7:G7)
~~~~

Use the SUM function to find the total revenue of Product A, Product C, and Consulting, all for JANUARY ONLY. Hint: The arguments look like this (?, ?, ?)

~~~~
=SUM(B2,B4,B6)
~~~~


The COUNT function counts all the cells that contain numbers in a specified range. Try typing =COUNT(A2:E2) to get a return value of 4

~~~~
=COUNT(A2:E2)
~~~~

COUNT only counts the cells that contain numbers. What would =COUNT(A1:A5) return?

~~~~
3
~~~~

Write a COUNT function that counts how many students have at least one pet.

~~~~
=COUNT(B2:B8)
~~~~

The following table contains Q1 sales. Write a COUNT function to count how many sales people made at least one sale in January.

~~~~
=COUNT(B2:B5)
~~~~

Write a COUNT function that would count the number of months that Chuck made at least one sale in Q1 (January through March)

~~~~
=COUNT(B4:D4)
~~~~

In Excel, logical functions and decision-making are built with statements that evaluate to true or false. There are 6 logical operators to determine true or false, and they are listed in the table below.
The statement 1=1 is true, because 1 is equal to 1.
Would 1=2 evaluate to True or False?

~~~~
False
~~~~

The statement 1<>1 evaluates to false, because <> means "not equal to," and it would be false to say "1 is not equal to 1."
What would 1<>2 evaluate to?

~~~~
True
~~~~

The statement 4>=1 evaluates to true, because >= means "greater than or equal to," and 4 is greater than or equal to 1.
What would 1<=2 evaluate to?

~~~~
True
~~~~

What would 1<=1 evaluate to?

~~~~
True
~~~~


What would B5=C5 evaluate to?

B5 = 950, C5 = 950

~~~~
True
~~~~

What would B2>B3 evaluate to?

B2 = 1000, B3 = 1200

~~~~
False
~~~~

What would B2>=C6 evaluate to?

B2 = 1000, C6= 1000

~~~~
True
~~~~
